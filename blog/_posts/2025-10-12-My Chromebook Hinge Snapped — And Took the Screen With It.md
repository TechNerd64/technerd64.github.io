 # My Chromebook Hinge Snapped â€” And Took the Screen With It

I used to have a 2-in-1 Samsung touchscreen chromebook.  For 4 years, this was my main workstation.  Every scratch project I made, video I watched, etc. was done on this device, and all of a sudden the metal hinge snapped out of the frame.  

The hinge appeares to have broke the plastic frame and popped out while trying to open the screen.  When I tried reinserting the hinge into the screen it cracked the screen.

So, after around 4 months of it just sitting around, I decided I'd try opening it up for fun (yes, for FUN).

I took off the back cover which proved to be harder then expected due to both hidden screws and plastic tabs.

Then I got to the main board and battery.

Now you might notice that there is no screen attatched.  I found that I could just detach the screen from the chromebook board without impairing the laptop working.  I assumed that the laptop would check for missing components and not boot without them, but I was mistaken.

So, I disconnected them from each other.

Now the chromebook works the same (minus the lack of a display).  You just need to plug in a display via one of the USB-C ports.
