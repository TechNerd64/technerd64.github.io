# Day 2: First Games

Ok, so I completely forgot about making another post about Nationals, but here it is!

To be honest, I have no idea what teams we played or scores besides the fact that we lost our games.  Nevertheless, here are some pictures from the day.

Now, I do remember that these losses put us in the lowest bracket on the tournament, the Iron bracket.
