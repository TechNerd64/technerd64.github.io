# Day 1: The Drive-Up

In October, my volleyball team, Texas Lions, competed in the National Homeschool VolleyBall... championship?  It was a long name🙄 ok.

The drive up was over 10 hours with traffic, but we tried to find some fun stops to make.  

One of the first stops we made was in Oklahoma at a Braums.

Our next stops were more unique like the dog stop.

This was at a gas station in OK. which my mom found using Roadside America.

Lastly, we found a bizzare standing truck, yes, STANDING!  Now it's not like you think, the truck is sitting vertically like a tower.

But the sights we saw the most on our drive up were... drum, roll, please... COWS and WIND TURBINES.  I know right, very exciting!.

This raps up our drive up.  Hopefully, I remember to make more posts about the other days, but nevertheless, Thanks for Reading!
